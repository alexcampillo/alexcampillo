      <h1>Project Highlights</h1>
      <p>Authentic Form & Function team, In this slideshow you will find some of my personal favorite projects I've worked on. While they may not be my best technical design work, I think they make up for in concept, execution and personality. I believe your design is only as good as the idea it supports, nobody cares what it looks like if what you say is dumb.</p>

    	<h1>The Wang Thang</h1>
      <img src="{{site.url}}img/13.png" alt="...">
      <p>The Wang Thang was an on-demand chicken wing only restaurant I put together with my friend (teamwork yeah!). We we're up and running in one week! I doubled as head chef and designer and we double-teamed twitter. I drew so many chickens to get to this final concept poster.</p>

      <p>In our first two weeks we gained quite a <a href="#">twitter following</a>, even a celebrity endorsement from <a href="">Derrick Carter</a>, got press from <a href="">DNA Chicago</a>, <a href="">Chicagoinno</a> and <a href="">Urban Daddy</a>. We were also picked up by the food delivery service <a href="">Caviar</a>.</p>

      <p>If you're walking around the west loop of Chicago be on the lookout, wang thang posters are still wheat pasted everywhere!</p>

    	<h1>Mericastock</h1>

    	<p>"I don't like this... but I LOVE these pictures!" my client exclaimed. A silhouette of an 18-wheeler flying down the desert highway with an american flag burned into the sunset was full-span across my screen. "We get so many compliments on our website's photography." That was it, the market had just been dangled in front of my face! So I took it.</p>

    	<p>Mericastock was born over a weekend out of this bizarre exchange with my client. I made a logo, built a website and Photoshopped a couple of American flags into some open source stock photos I found and Mericastock was in business!</p>

    	<p>Mericastock's newsletter has over 100 subcribers and counting! It was also featured in featured in <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/03/whats-new-for-designers-march-2015/">Web Designer Depot's March 2015 New Resources List</a>. Someone even bought a mug on it's Shopify webstore, my first big win as a product designer!</p>

    	<h1>#DailyRockStar</h1>

    	<p>This is little sneak peak at what I'm working on right now.</p>

    	<p>Music has always been a big part of my life. I've listened to tons of music, I've played in bands, I've even written a few terrible songs (no you can't hear them). I think music is important to everybody, </p>
