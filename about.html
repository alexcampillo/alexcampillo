			<!-- <p> Sounds strange but it's hard to explain it over beats In the lab daily rocking two or three shows a week Going mad crazy stressing over press and your release Trying to please labels while you keep your rep up in the streets At the same time trying to breath And on my down time, trying to find a fine breeze But see im underground so now I gotta find cheese Just to take her out to dinner Just to eat and get a kiss up on the cheek.</p> 

			<p>But for me it's even harder Cause I ain't got a car to pick them up in So chicks already think they put enough in Plus im kind of cute so its hard for them to trust him Asking what im doing every night like I be screwing every night what Truth is, im bruising every mic that I come across And every now and then, drop a hundred off Just so you can fucking floss, but that's not enough for you So I take another loss, wondering why I fucked with you Knowing I got stuff to do.</p> -->
