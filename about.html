			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<h2>Hi, I'm Alex</h2>


			<p>I'm a designer, developer and entreprenuer from Chicago, Illinois. Since graduating from the University of Illinois at Chicago I've helped create and grow multiple startups, including <a href="https://appdevy.com">AppDevy</a>, which was named one of <a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/2015/02/04/50-chicago-startups-watch-2015">Chicago's 50 startups to watch</a> this past year!</p>

			<p>In my spare time I love to draw, check out my <a href="https://instagram.com/_alexcampillo">instagram</a> and work on my own side projects which you can check out <a href="{{site.url}}/adventures">here</a>!</p>
