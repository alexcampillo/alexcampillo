            <h1>Tapeography:</h1>
            <h2>Design, Motivational Posters</h2>
            <p>Tapeography was a series of motivational posters I created for Forum Coworking. The only materials used were electrical tape and white paper.  Sometimes it feels good to just step away from the computer and try and make something you're proud of with whatever else you have.  I ended up making a series for my apartment as well, they keep me going throughout the day.</p>
